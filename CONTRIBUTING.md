# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this educational repository. A quick checklist for contributions:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `feature/<short-desc>`.
2. Write tests for new functionality and ensure existing tests pass.
3. Run formatting and linting locally: `black .`, `isort .`, `flake8 .`.
4. Add documentation to `README.md` or `Step.md` as appropriate.
5. Open a pull request describing changes and link any relevant issues.

Maintainers will review code for correctness, reproducibility, and clarity. Keep changes small and focused.
