# Technical Design Document

## Context
The spam classification system requires a comprehensive model selection and comparison interface to allow users to analyze and compare different machine learning models.

## Goals
- Implement intuitive model selection
- Enable real-time model comparison
- Provide detailed performance analysis
- Ensure efficient model switching

## Non-Goals
- Automated model selection
- Online model training
- External API integration
- Distributed processing

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Model Management
Decision: Store all trained models in session state
Rationale:
- Quick model switching
- Maintains prediction speed
- Enables real-time comparison

### 2. Interface Design
Decision: Place model selection in sidebar
Rationale:
- Consistent access point
- Clear visibility
- Standard Streamlit pattern

### 3. Visualization Strategy
Decision: Use Plotly for interactive charts
Rationale:
- High interactivity
- Custom styling support
- Real-time updates

## Implementation Details

### Model Storage
```python
st.session_state.all_models = {
    'model_name': {
        'model': trained_model,
        'metrics': performance_metrics
    }
}
```

### Model Selection
```python
selected_model = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Select model for analysis",
    available_models,
    key="selected_model"
)
```

### Performance Visualization
```python
def plot_model_comparison(models, metrics):
    fig = go.Figure()
    for model_name, model_metrics in metrics.items():
        fig.add_trace(...)
    return fig
```

## Risk Analysis
1. Memory Usage
   - Risk: High memory consumption with multiple models
   - Mitigation: Efficient model storage and cleanup

2. Performance
   - Risk: Slow model switching
   - Mitigation: Optimize visualization updates

3. User Experience
   - Risk: Complex interface
   - Mitigation: Clear layout and tooltips

## Migration Plan
1. Phase 1: Basic Implementation
   - Add model selection
   - Implement basic visualization

2. Phase 2: Enhancement
   - Add comparative analysis
   - Implement feature importance

3. Phase 3: Optimization
   - Performance improvements
   - Memory optimization
