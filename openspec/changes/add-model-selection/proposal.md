# Model Selection Implementation

## Why
To enhance user experience and model analysis capabilities by implementing a comprehensive model selection and comparison interface.

## What Changes
- Added multiple model training support
- Implemented model selection dropdown in sidebar
- Added comparative visualization capabilities
- Enhanced real-time prediction interface
- Improved model performance analysis

## Impact
### Affected Specs
- Model training specification
- UI/UX guidelines
- Performance metrics specification

### Affected Code
- `src/app_streamlit.py`
