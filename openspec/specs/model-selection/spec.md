# Model Selection and Comparison Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the requirements for the model selection and comparison functionality in the spam classification system.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Multiple Model Support
The system SHALL support training and evaluation of multiple classification models.

#### Scenario: Model Training
- **WHEN** training is initiated
- **THEN** all supported models are trained:
  - SVM
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression

#### Scenario: Model Performance Comparison
- **WHEN** models are trained
- **THEN** comparative metrics are generated:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC curves
  - PR curves

### Requirement: Model Selection Interface
The system SHALL provide an intuitive interface for model selection and comparison.

#### Scenario: Model Switching
- **WHEN** user selects a different model
- **THEN** all visualizations and metrics update accordingly
- **AND** the selected model is used for predictions

#### Scenario: Live Testing
- **WHEN** user inputs test data
- **THEN** the currently selected model is used for prediction
- **AND** prediction confidence scores are displayed
- **AND** feature importance is visualized

### Requirement: Performance Visualization
The system SHALL provide comprehensive performance visualizations.

#### Scenario: Metric Display
- **WHEN** a model is selected
- **THEN** show:
  - ROC curve with AUC
  - Precision-Recall curve
  - Confusion matrix
  - Feature importance plot

### Requirement: Model Persistence
The system SHALL maintain model state across sessions.

#### Scenario: Model Loading
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** load all trained models
- **AND** restore previous model selection
- **AND** maintain model comparison capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Model Training
   ```
   Input Data -> Preprocessing -> Multiple Model Training -> Model Storage
   ```

2. Model Selection
   ```
   User Selection -> Model Loading -> Update Visualizations -> Real-time Predictions
   ```

### Performance Requirements
- Model switching response time: < 1 second
- Visualization update time: < 2 seconds
- Prediction response time: < 500ms

### User Interface Requirements
1. Model Selection Component
   - Dropdown menu in sidebar
   - Clear model labels
   - Current model indicator

2. Performance Display
